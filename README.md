# Title
Attendance during a streak? When do people go to the game? Unclear
# Abstract

# Introduction and Background
Baseball baseball baseball.
Something here about being Canada's team, baseball, attendance etc.

We looked at streak rather than rank because the rank only shows within the AL East without a contextual analysis of how the AL East fits into the rest of the leauge standings.

# Limits of the Study (MAK added this header)
- Does not consider the tv audience
- Does not account for the impacts of the playoffs at this time.
- We have not considered the seasonality of the data. There is some pretty clear growth. Some complexity here because we would have to line up the days of the week, and we would have to line up the home opener/play offs and I'm not sure how we do that effectively.

# Description of the method of your study
- Have not considered weather impact because the Roger's Centre has the retractable roof. This would have to be considered in any analysis of other stadiums.

- We're going to have some graphs, and we're going to have some ANOVA. It's going to be great.

- We need to make sure we talk about the requirements of running a MANOVA, and that they data that we're looking at works for is.

# Results and Discussion
Check out the python notebook.
Coles notes:
steak wasn't a relevant factor. (streak not steak)

# Conclusions



# Future Work
- Compare the home and away audiences.
